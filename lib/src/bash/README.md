The files in this folder establish the client-side git hooks for a student (or other) project that wants to use the
flow-monitoring system.

See the top-level README.md for the details, but the short form is that this folder -- exactly -- will be placed in a
student repo at the git root of the project, i.e. as a sibling folder to wherever .git/ is located.
